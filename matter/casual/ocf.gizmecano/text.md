The [OCF website](http://ocf.gizmecano.net) is a dummy store whose only purpose is to present and set in motion the opencart-3-fr language pack designed for the [OpenCart e-commerce](https://www.opencart.com/) application. 

This pack is available in two variants: a [free variant](https://github.com/gizmecano/opencart-3-fr) which contains all files necessary for basic running of an online shop and a [full version](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=40999) which gathers additional files required for various extensions related to vendors services.
