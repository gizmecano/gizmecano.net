Hidden behind an acronym (which stands for *Miscellanées numériques d'un ours*, translatable as _Digital Miscellanies of a Bear_), the [MNO website](http://mno.gizmecano.net/) is a blog dedicated to various problems involved by ubiquitous uses of computer tools.

In doing so, this project is also a playground to tweak a little with [Grav](https://github.com/getgrav/grav), an open source flat-file content management system, and more particularly with various aspects concerning themes and templates.
