# Hello world!

Welcome to this laboratory, a showcase built to present a choice of side projects and various experiments, mainly in the web design field...

The items listed below have been designed by [P. Mergey](https://twitter.com/gizmecano), a craftsman who [makes miscellaneous things](http://mergey.ch/) using mostly a keyboard and a mouse, [pushes omnifarious bytes](https://github.com/gizmecano) from time to time and [publishes variegated pixels](https://dribbble.com/gizmecano) once in a while.
